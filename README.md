# project-catan (requires javaSE-13)

## Iteration 1: Basic info
  - What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * Andy worked on the main User Story, the visual game board
    * Jakob set up all the data structures needed to run the game. These will likely evolve over time 
    * Evan set up our testing system so we can validadate the functionality of our datastructures and eventually other functions
    
  - What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
    * Making the game board interactive, which requires connecting the datastructures to the game board class
    * Implementing game logic
    
  - Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
    * the datastructures are implemented and work, but havent been connected to the game board
    * The visuals for the gameboard are in place, but nothing is interactive yet
